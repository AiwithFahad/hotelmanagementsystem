#Working fine on local; chatbox works properly on live.

Online VAPI connectivity issue.
# Vapi AI Instructions
(VAPI AI is working properly on the local PC web host but not on Vercel hosting.)
1. Get Your Vapi Public API Key

Open the Vapi Dashboard
(Usually at: https://dashboard.vapi.ai — if you don’t see it directly, try logging in and navigating to Organization Settings → API Keys). 
Vapi AI #support

Generate or copy your Public Key

You’ll see a public or client API key.

Copy it — you’ll use that in your front‑end app.

✅ 2. Whitelist Your Domain (If Supported)

Right now, Vapi may offer a way to restrict a public API key to certain domains, but the dashboard UI for whitelisting domains is sometimes glitchy (support has acknowledged possible saving issues).

Here’s what to try:

🔹 Steps to Whitelist

Go to API Key settings in Vapi Dashboard.

Look for a field like Allowed Domains / Origin Whitelist.

Add:

Save the settings.

🔎 If you don’t see this field or the setting doesn’t stick:

It’s likely a UI/feature issue on Vapi’s side right now.

In that case, you don’t need to do anything more in Vapi itself — the public key will still work, but it won’t be restricted to that domain.

💡 Restricting domains is optional — it’s a security enhancement not a requirement to make the integration work.
